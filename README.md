Here, I will upload all of the information and responses that the university has instructed me to complete throughout the assignment coursework. <br><br>
The assignment is structured into three sections, each focusing on a specific technology:

Section 1: Google Colab, GitHub, Oracle Apex, and Python

This section likely delves into the setup and utilization of Google Colab for cloud-based development.
It might also explore using GitHub for version control and collaboration on code projects.
You might have used Python for specific tasks within the Oracle Apex development process, and this section would detail that integration.
Section 2: Google Colab and Python

This section likely provides a deeper exploration of Python programming concepts used in the assignment.
It might showcase how you leveraged Google Colab's environment for Python coding and execution.
Specific Python libraries or modules relevant to your assignment might be covered here.
Section 3: MongoDB

This section focuses on MongoDB and its role in the assignment.
It might explain how you used MongoDB to store, manipulate, or query data.
You might have used Python or another language to interact with MongoDB, and this section would detail that interaction.
